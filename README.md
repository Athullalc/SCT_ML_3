# SCT_ML_3
Task 3 Completed. This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish between images of cats and dogs using the Dogs vs. Cats dataset. The goal is to train a simple and interpretable image classifier using classical machine learning techniques.
The images are preprocessed by resizing and flattening, then used to train a linear SVM classifier. The model is evaluated using standard metrics and can also predict the class of new, unseen images.
This project is ideal for beginners in machine learning who want to understand image classification fundamentals using traditional models.
